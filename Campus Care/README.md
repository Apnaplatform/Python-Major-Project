### A Python CLI-Based Application with MySQL Database Integration

A command-line application designed to simplify student complaint management in educational institutions. The system allows students to register, log in, submit complaints, and track their complaint status, while administrators can manage complaints and update their resolution status.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Student Complaint Management System is developed using Python and MySQL.

It provides a structured platform where students can submit complaints related to college facilities, laboratories, classrooms, and other academic services.

The administrator can view registered students, review submitted complaints, and update their status as Pending, In Progress, or Solved.

The application automatically creates the required database and tables when it runs, reducing the need for manual database setup.
